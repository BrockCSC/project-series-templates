  - Support different color schemes HSV, RGBI, etc.

### Challenges
Easy Challenges:
  - Include help command to re-display overview help screen

  - Dot painting filter

## Getting Started
  1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  2. Install the [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library (Instructions [here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html))
  3. Open Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the Pixelate folder
  4. Type `python Main.py` and the program will run

Note: At the current time, the implementation work with both versions of python
